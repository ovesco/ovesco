# Hi.

I'm Guillaume, a developer from Switzerland. My fields of interest are mainly web, big data and data structures.

This is my personal blog, I'll put stuff I discover and experiment with that I find interesting.
This was originally developed as a project for my SoftwEng MSE Master course at HES-SO Switzerland.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/ovesco).
